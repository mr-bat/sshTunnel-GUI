# ssh -D GUI

Performing `ssh -D` with GUI. Program is further development of [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start). It's now for my personal use, that's why it is very primitive.

### Development

It is as easy as performing the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mr-bat/sshTunnel-GUI.git
$ cd sshTunnel-GUI
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
